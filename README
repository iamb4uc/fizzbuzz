  =========================================  

Just for educational purposes, if you are new to
programming, or want to learn new programming
language, fizzbuzz is one of the most important
interview questions you will find. So this
repository will help you understand how to approach
this problem without loosing your sanity and real
life relationship. Initially it has all the
languages I know about and have a decent grasp the
working of those language, but new contributors are
always welcome to contribute.

If you find something unusual either create a issue
or create a pull request to make it more efficient.

This is just a fun project. Cause I am bored, also
watched too much fireship, ig.

Feel free to contribute to this with new languages
that I dont know how to write or am unaware of.

To create a PR follow these rules:
- Give a good name.
- Explain why should your code be added to this
  repository.
- If improving existing files explain why it is
  better than the previous implementation.

I am not too harsh on contributors but dont be that
guy who discourages others to participate. I always
support new contributors.
